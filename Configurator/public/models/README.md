Place your chips bag 3D model file in this folder and name it `chips_bag.glb`.

Recommended format: GLB (binary glTF). If your model uses external textures, place them alongside the GLB and update the loader path in `src/three/scene.js`.

Example path used by the demo: `./public/models/chips_bag.glb`

If you don't have a GLB yet, export from Blender or use a converter to glTF/GLB.
